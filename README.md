# Spotify_replica
This project is a frontend-only replica of the Spotify music app, built using HTML and CSS. It recreates the Spotify layout with a sidebar, playlist section, album art, and music controls. This clone is for UI/UX. Great for learning responsive web design and modern layout techniques.
